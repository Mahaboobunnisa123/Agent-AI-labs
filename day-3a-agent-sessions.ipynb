This was a slow, expensive, and often inefficient process. Advanced screening and high-throughput technologies, often coupled with AI, aim to dramatically:\n\n*   **Increase the number of compounds tested.**\n*   **Reduce the time it takes to test them.**\n*   **Improve the accuracy and reliability of the tests.**\n*   **Automate the entire process.**\n\n**Key Components and Technologies:**\n\n1.  **High-Throughput Screening (HTS):**\n    *   **What it is:** HTS involves using robotics, liquid handling, and automated data capture to test hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of chemical compounds against a specific biological target (like an enzyme or receptor) in a short period.\n    *   **How it works:** Samples are often placed in small wells (e.g., in 96-, 384-, or 1536-well plates). Robots dispense reagents, and detection systems (like fluorescent readers or luminescence detectors) measure the interaction between the compound and the target.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI can help in several ways:\n        *   **Designing better screening assays:** Optimizing the conditions for testing.\n        *   **Analyzing screening data:** Identifying \"hits\" (compounds that show activity) and differentiating them from false positives.\n        *   **Prioritizing compounds for follow-up:** Suggesting which hits are most likely to be viable leads based on predicted properties.\n\n2.  **Robotics and Automation:**\n    *   **What it is:** Sophisticated robotic systems are the backbone of HTS. They handle liquid dispensing, plate manipulation, sample storage, and even the synthesis of some compounds.\n    *   **Benefits:**\n        *   **Reproducibility:** Robots perform tasks consistently, reducing human error.\n        *   **Speed:** They can work 24/7 without fatigue.\n        *   **Miniaturization:** They enable the use of very small volumes of expensive reagents.\n    *   **AI Integration:** AI can optimize the scheduling and operation of these robotic systems, making the entire workflow more efficient.\n\n3.  **Miniaturization and Microfluidics:**\n    *   **What it is:** Performing experiments in extremely small volumes (nanoliters or picoliters) using specialized devices (microplates, microfluidic chips).\n    *   **Benefits:**\n        *   **Reduced Reagent Consumption:** Saves significant costs, especially when dealing with rare or expensive materials.\n        *   **Faster Reaction Times:** Smaller volumes often lead to quicker chemical and biological reactions.\n        *   **Higher Throughput:** More experiments can be packed into a smaller space.\n\n4.  **Advanced Detection Technologies:**\n    *   **Fluorescence and Luminescence:** Commonly used to measure biochemical reactions where a signal is emitted when a compound interacts with a target.\n    *   **Mass Spectrometry:** Used for identifying and quantifying molecules, crucial for confirming compound identity and purity.\n    *   **Label-Free Detection:** Technologies that can detect interactions without needing to attach fluorescent tags, which can sometimes interfere with the interaction itself.\n\n5.  **Phenotypic Screening:**\n    *   **What it is:** Instead of focusing on a single target (like an enzyme), phenotypic screening looks at how a compound affects a whole cell or organism. It observes a visible change (phenotype) that indicates therapeutic activity.\n    *   **AI's Role:** Analyzing complex images or cellular behavior to identify subtle phenotypic changes that might not be obvious to the human eye. This is particularly useful for discovering drugs for diseases where the specific target is unknown.\n\n**How it Connects to AI-Driven Drug Design:**\n\nThink of it as a powerful synergy:\n\n*   **AI designs a set of promising \"candidate\" molecules.**\n*   **Advanced screening technologies rapidly test these candidates against biological targets or in cellular models.**\n*   **AI analyzes the screening results to identify the \"hits.\"**\n*   **AI can then further refine these hits, predict their properties, and guide the next round of testing.**\n\nThis iterative loop of AI design, high-throughput testing, and AI analysis dramatically accelerates the early stages of drug discovery, moving from identifying potential targets and molecules to finding validated lead compounds much faster than ever before.\n\n**Why is this development important?**\n\n*   **Speed:** It dramatically reduces the time it takes to get from a conceptual idea to a potential drug candidate.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** By using smaller amounts of reagents and automating processes, it can reduce the enormous cost associated with early-stage drug discovery.\n*   **Broader Exploration:** It allows researchers to explore a much larger chemical space and identify novel compounds that might have been missed by traditional methods.\n*   **Enabling AI:** Without these rapid screening capabilities, the vast number of molecules AI can design would be impossible to test effectively.\n\nThis development is not just about having better machines; it's about fundamentally re-engineering the experimental process itself to be more efficient, data-rich, and integrated with computational power.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The companies involved in advanced screening and high-throughput technologies within drug discovery are diverse, ranging from **specialized technology providers** that develop the automation and detection equipment, to **biotech and pharmaceutical companies** that use these technologies as a core part of their R&D, and even **contract research organizations (CROs)** that offer these services.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key players and categories:\n\n**1.

Specialized Niche Players:**\n\n*   **Compound Library Providers:** Companies that curate and sell large collections of diverse chemical compounds (e.g., **Enamine, ChemBridge, ZINC Database (academic/open access)**) are essential partners in HTS.\n*   **AI/Machine Learning Software Providers:** While not directly hardware, companies developing advanced software for analyzing HTS data and integrating it with predictive models are also key.\n\n**Key Trends:**\n\n*   **Integration with AI:** The biggest trend is the seamless integration of HTS with AI. AI is not just analyzing the data; it's guiding the design of experiments, prioritizing compounds, and even suggesting new molecules to synthesize and test.\n*   **Data-Centric Approaches:** HTS generates massive amounts of data. Companies are focusing on building robust data infrastructure and AI platforms to extract maximum value from this data.\n*   **Phenotypic Screening Growth:** As mentioned before, there's a growing interest in phenotypic screening, which often requires specialized imaging and analysis technologies that are now being integrated into HTS platforms.\n\nIn essence, the companies involved are creating an ecosystem: technology providers build the tools, CROs and pharma/biotech companies use those tools to test millions of compounds, and AI companies help make sense of the results and design the next generation of tests and molecules.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
